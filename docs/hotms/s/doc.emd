Functional safety drives many of the security positions in OT infrastructure. However, Traditional OT networks relied on
air gap networks to secure communications between machines, controllers, and devices. This security position has left a
gap that exposes OT infrastructure to cyber-attacks, data leakage, and data spoofing. Recently, some new techniques have
been used to overcome OTâ€™s myopic security position. These are represented as components of the secure communication
subsystem.
