Cyber-attack prevention comes in many different flavors, techniques, and strategies. Not all IT best practices apply to
the OT space because of the traditionally limited access to OT networks. However, this is changing as OT devices share
data more readily with IT networks and devices.

Because of the potential cross-over between OT and IT, a re-evaluation of IT prevention best practices should be part of
the OT Cyber Prevention strategy.
