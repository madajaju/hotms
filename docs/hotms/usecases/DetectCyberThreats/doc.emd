Traditionally cyber threat detection Requires data analytics on large volumes of network logs, machine logs, and access
logs. Because OT networks in the past have been isolated, many organizations have not spent the time or resources to
monitor OT networks like their IT networks. This myopic view of the Cyber threat landscape has led to some historic
cyber breaches over the last ten years.

IT’s cyber threat detection techniques should be leveraged to improve OT’s detection capabilities. Additionally, OT
and IT bridges and gateways should be monitored from both sides of the bridge to monitor and protect critical
infrastructure.
