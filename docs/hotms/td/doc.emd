iMany of the same techniques for threat detection can be utilized from it for OT infrastructure. This includes state
analytics on network, host, and system logs searching for known patterns of cyber intrusion. However, OT network traffic
on the control plane is fundamentally different than traditional IT network traffic and much more predictable. This
predictability can give threat detection algorithms better insight into network security, finding intrusions much
faster.
