Identifying vulnerabilities is traditional cybersecurity IT best practice, which also has its place in the OT
cybersecurity environment. For example, scanning network and security configurations in the OT environment is critical
for preventing cyber-attacks in the future. However, hardware scanning is not the only type of vulnerability scanning
performed. It also includes operating system scanning and software scanning. Identity and access management scanning as
well.

Scanning for vulnerabilities is not the only aspect of identifying vulnerabilities. Mapping those vulnerabilities to
known vulnerabilities in the industry, updating risk management systems, and prioritizing those risks against those
vulnerabilities are critical for identifying vulnerability use cases.
