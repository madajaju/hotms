In some respects, the data plane has been ignored in OT infrastructure, where machine telemetry, sensor data, and
environmental data can be fused to provide insight into business operations, including preventive maintenance, scheduled
downtime, optimizations of workflows, and increased functional safety.

Because many deep analytics tools are unavailable on IoT infrastructure, much of the OT Data must be moved to IT
infrastructure to perform this work. The reluctance to connect OT in its networks is Primarily due to the fear of
IT-based cyber-attacks spilling over to OT infrastructure. Managing the data plane and control plane separately is vital
to ensuring cross-contamination.
