Many OT designs focus on the control plan of the OT systems, which control and manage level 0-2 infrastructure entities.
Since these are critical to functional safety, limited access to the control plane must be maintained and audited.
Segmenting the control plane and data plane is essential in securing OT infrastructure. Network traffic over the control
plane fundamentally differs from network traffic on the data plane.
